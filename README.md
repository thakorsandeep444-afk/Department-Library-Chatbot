# Department Library AI Chatbot Portal

A production-ready, premium Department Library Web Portal designed for a Diploma Engineering College. This project mimics a professional college system rather than a standard student project, utilizing glassmorphism aesthetics, a blue/white/cyan layout, full light/dark theme compatibility, Animate on Scroll (AOS), and dynamic charts.

It features a **Dual-Mode Data Layer** that runs entirely client-side using `localStorage` and a rich pre-seeded dataset by default, allowing you to test all functions (adding/editing books, notice boards, AI chatbot responses) immediately. It connects to a live **Firebase (Auth & Firestore)** database once credentials are supplied in the configurations.

## Getting Started (Immediate Testing)

The project is structured to run immediately in your browser without compiling.

1. **Serve locally**: Run a local HTTP server in the project directory:
   ```bash
   # Using Node.js (recommended)
   npx http-server ./
   
   # Or using Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
2. **Open website**: Open the generated address in your browser (e.g. `http://localhost:8080` or `http://localhost:8000`).
3. **Demo credentials**:
   - **Student Account**: `student@college.edu` | Password: `student123`
   - **Admin Account**: `admin@college.edu` | Password: `admin123`

## AI Chatbot Capabilities

Liby, our virtual AI librarian assistant, is accessible via the floating trigger icon on the bottom right of the screen.
- **Natural Language Parsing**: Analyzes user tokens against the keyword mapping index in the FAQs database.
- **Dynamic Catalog Searches**: If you ask: *"Is Andrew Tanenbaum book available?"* the bot queries the books database, locates Tanenbaum's computer networking book, and reports rack locations and remaining copy counts.
- **Faculty Directory Lookup**: Ask: *"Snhea Shah email contact"* to fetch designations, qualifications, and direct contacts.
- **Speech Recognition (STT)**: Use the microphone button to dictate questions.
- **Speech Synthesis (TTS)**: Speak the answers aloud, toggled using the header speaker icon.
- **State Persistence**: Chat logs are cached in `sessionStorage` and persist across page navigation transitions.

## Administrative Powers
The Admin dashboard (`admin.html`) is accessible to users logged in with the `admin` role.
- **Real-Time Catalog Changes**: Add, Edit, or Delete books, faculty members, notices, and GTU papers.
- **FAQ Tutoring Panel**: Directly add or modify keyword associations and answers to train Liby's NLP engine.
- **Interactive Analytics**: Doughnut charts of book stocks update as soon as quantities are edited in the catalog.
